# mwbot.toml file
The mwbot.toml file should be present and contain the following fields
- api_url: URL to the api endpoint of the wiki (should end with api.php)
- rest_url: URL to the rest api endpoint of the wiki (should end with /api/rest_v1)
- [auth] field
  - username: username that the bot will use to login
  - password: the bot password to use the wiki (and the main reason the file isn't included in the repo)
